=======================

Alfred Workflow for french conjugation

### What works 

- [x] Consulting french XML database
- [x] Shows verb conjugation with pronoms
- [x] copy to clipboard the selected verb
- [x] Indicative present

### Some issues that need to be fixed

- [ ] Order of pronomns not always showing in correct order. (je","tu","il/elle","nous","vous","ils/elles"), the pronom with their respective verbs it is 0k
- [ ] Code?
- [ ] Lag before show the results

### What can be great

- [ ] Direct input to select the desired time to conjugate
- [ ] Get some fancy images
- [ ] New great ideas

### Usage

Conjugate Indicative present
```
cip verb
```

I included cii for indicative imperfect, but it is a hard modified version of the original loop, it will be great to enter cii or cip and automaticaly search for the desired time to conjugate

#### Project description

This workflow born by the necesity to get a fast conjugation reference, I made this workflow with just one day of learning and googling python so maybe the code it is not so great, that's why I commented the code, if you can clean it or improve you are welcome !
